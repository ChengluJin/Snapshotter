In the future, we can implement this scheme to a complete industrial control network, which has a real powerful server connected to. This can help us study how much this scheme can be scale in practice, due to the constraints on the network bandwidth or a certain application. 

Also, we need to try to find a more efficient mitigation strategy, that affects the real industrial process as little as possible.
