The usage of our implementaion is exactly same as the original OpenPLC
implementation. 
1. 
run "./build.sh"
select Y
select 4 for raspberry pi

2.
run "sudo nodejs server.js"

3.
open browser
got to "localhost:8080"

4.
upload the code "malicious_code.st" in st_files folder. In st_files folder,
"malicious_code.st" will keep the LED on for 3 seconds after the switch
turns off. But the clean state "helloworld.st" will keep the LED on for 2
seconds.   

5.
Open "Snapshotter IDS Log"

6.
Swith the button on the board to trigger the malicious behaviour.  You will
see that the intrusion is detected, and the system is restored to a clean
state. This means that "helloworld.st" is uploaded automatically.
