\begin{abstract}
In recent years, more and more industrial control systems, which were created before Internet, are connected to the network. It becomes very crucial for us to understand, analyze and improve the security of these industrial control systems when they are connected to the network. As the core in an industrial control system, programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are controlling the industrial process given some inputs. 

In this project, we investigate the attacking scenario that the malicious adversaries are connected in the network, and submit any malicious logic to the PLCs to generate some wrong outputs from the PLCs to further hurt the industrial processes. We suggest to use stealthy logging mechanism in this scenario to send the status of the PLCs to a central monitoring server in a secure and stealthy way periodically. This method can verify the integrity of the log and the adversary is not able figure out whether he gets caught or not. After an intrusion is detected, the server will restart the infected PLCs with a known clean state. This will carry on the normal operation of the industrial processes.
